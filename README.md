Python-funkwhale is a lightweight wrapper over the [Funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio) API. Only dependent on [Requests,](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/) the idea of this wrapper is to support as much of the [Funkwhale API](https://docs.funkwhale.audio/api.html) as possible and be ready for new additions without needing to add a single line of code.
